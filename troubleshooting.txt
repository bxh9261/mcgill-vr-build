✅ 1. Check VR Plugin Compatibility
Make sure you are using the correct XR plugin for SteamVR. Unity deprecated the built-in OpenVR support in recent versions.

If you're using Unity 2020.1+:

You must use the SteamVR Plugin from the Unity Asset Store.

Install SteamVR Unity Plugin (from Valve) via the Unity Package Manager or Asset Store.

Also install XR Plugin Management and enable OpenVR Loader under the XR Plug-in Management > PC, Mac & Linux Standalone settings.

✅ 2. Ensure the Build Uses the Correct XR Runtime
Even if OpenVR is referenced, Unity might default to Oculus or another runtime. Here's what to check:

Go to Windows Settings > Mixed Reality > Startup and Desktop > OpenXR Runtime.

Or, open SteamVR Settings > Developer > Set SteamVR as OpenXR Runtime.

Make sure SteamVR is the active OpenXR runtime.

✅ 3. Check That SteamVR Is Running
Your Unity build won’t auto-launch SteamVR unless:

SteamVR is running.

A headset is detected and active.

SteamVR is configured as the OpenXR runtime.

✅ 4. Missing or Misconfigured Action Manifest
The following line looks correct:

makefile
Copy
Edit
ActionManifestFileRelativeFilePath: StreamingAssets\SteamVR\actions.json
But ensure that:

actions.json actually exists in StreamingAssets/SteamVR/ in the built project.

The path is correct for the OS (Windows uses \, but Unity might need / in some cases).

The manifest is valid (check for typos or malformed JSON).

You are calling SteamVR_Actions.PreInitialize() if you're customizing input in early script calls.

✅ 5. StereoRenderingMode and InitializationType
These are fine:

StereoRenderingMode: 1 = Single Pass Instanced (valid)

InitializationType: 1 = Manual (requires SteamVR to be initialized in code)

If you're using manual initialization, make sure you're calling SteamVR.Initialize() or SteamVR_Behaviour is being used early enough.

✅ 6. Unity Build Settings
Ensure the following:

In Player Settings > XR Plug-in Management, OpenVR (or SteamVR) is enabled.

The scene you're building actually uses VR content and calls the SteamVR SDK.

The headset is working in other VR apps (to rule out a hardware issue).

✅ 7. EditorAppKey
makefile
Copy
Edit
EditorAppKey: application.generated.unity.myproject.exe
This should not usually block launching SteamVR, but:

If you’re using this in a deployed app, make sure it's registered correctly in SteamVR’s app manifest (mostly needed for advanced use).

Consider removing this line temporarily to test.

✅ 8. MirrorView: 2
This just configures how the VR view is mirrored to the desktop. Should not affect launching VR.

✅ TL;DR - Suggested Fixes
Ensure SteamVR plugin is installed and set up correctly.

Make SteamVR the active OpenXR runtime.

Ensure SteamVR is running before launch.

Double-check XR Plug-in Management and build settings.

If using manual init, ensure SteamVR.Initialize() is called in code.
